# Canvas Designer, Extended

This is a toy project to reimplement the canvas designer language and its
runtime as a monorepo. It is inspired by [CanvasDesigner][CanvasDesigner].

The parser is rewritten with [parsimmon][parsimmon]. And the AST should be typed
with [flow][flow] in the future. It should also have a runtime in vanilla JS.
